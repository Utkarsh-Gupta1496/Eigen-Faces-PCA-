This Repository demonstrates how we can generate **Eigen Faces** using PCA.

**Dataset Used** : Yale Face Database
  1. Load the data from the following link and place it in ./data folder:
     http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database
     
**Features:** \
  Each Image is flattened into a vector and this vector is treated as a feature vector
  Data Matrix : Datapoints x Feature_Vector
       
**Technique Used** : Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-[High Dimmensional]

Sample Output :  **Top 8 Eigen Faces**
